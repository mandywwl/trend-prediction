# Background Timer Implementation Summary

## Problem Solved

**Original Issue**: The dashboard and cache only updated when events were being processed. When the event queue became idle (no new events), the `_update_metrics_and_cache` function was not called, causing the dashboard to become stale.

**Root Cause**: The `RuntimeGlue.run_stream()` method only checked for updates (`_should_update_metrics()`) during event processing. When no events were available, the loop would wait indefinitely, and no dashboard updates occurred.

## Solution Implemented

### Background Timer Architecture

Added a **background timer thread** to `RuntimeGlue` that:

1. **Runs independently** of event processing
2. **Periodically calls** `_update_metrics_and_cache()` based on configured interval
3. **Respects shutdown signals** for clean termination
4. **Is thread-safe** to prevent race conditions
5. **Can be disabled** via configuration if needed

### Key Components

#### 1. Timer Thread Management
- `_start_background_timer()`: Starts the background timer
- `_stop_background_timer()`: Stops the timer gracefully  
- `_timer_loop()`: Main timer loop that runs in background thread

#### 2. Thread Safety
- Added `threading.Lock()` (`_update_lock`) to protect concurrent access
- Ensures only one thread can update metrics/cache at a time

#### 3. Configuration Control
- Added `enable_background_timer: bool = True` to `RuntimeConfig`
- Can be controlled via YAML configuration
- Defaults to enabled for continuous updates

#### 4. Lifecycle Integration
- Timer starts automatically when `run_stream()` is called
- Timer stops automatically during shutdown
- Integrates cleanly with existing signal handlers

## Files Modified

### Core Implementation
- **`src/service/runtime_glue.py`**: Added background timer functionality

### Configuration  
- **`example_runtime_config.yaml`**: Configuration example with documentation

### Testing
- **`tests/unit/test_runtime_glue.py`**: Added comprehensive tests
- **`test_background_timer.py`**: Isolated timer testing
- **`test_integration.py`**: Integration testing
- **`demo_fix.py`**: User-friendly demonstration
- **`final_validation.py`**: Complete validation test

## Benefits Achieved

### ✅ Continuous Dashboard Updates
- Dashboard stays fresh even during idle periods
- Cache updates happen on schedule regardless of event frequency
- No more stale data during quiet periods

### ✅ Minimal Performance Impact
- Timer runs in separate daemon thread
- Only updates when interval threshold is met
- Thread-safe concurrent access

### ✅ Configurable Behavior
- Can enable/disable via configuration
- Adjustable update intervals
- Backwards compatible (enabled by default)

### ✅ Robust Error Handling
- Timer continues running despite errors
- Graceful shutdown with proper cleanup
- No interference with main event processing

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage (Default Behavior)
```python
# Background timer is enabled by default
config = RuntimeConfig()  # enable_background_timer=True
glue = RuntimeGlue(handler, config)
glue.run_stream(event_stream)  # Timer starts automatically
```

### Custom Configuration
```yaml
# runtime_config.yaml
runtime:
  enable_background_timer: true
  update_interval_sec: 30  # Update every 30 seconds
```

### Disabling Background Timer
```yaml
# For minimal resource usage or testing
runtime:
  enable_background_timer: false  # Only update during event processing
```

## Testing Validation

All tests pass successfully:

1. **Timer Lifecycle**: Start/stop functionality works correctly
2. **Thread Safety**: Concurrent access handled properly  
3. **Cache Updates**: Cache continues updating during idle periods
4. **Integration**: Works seamlessly with main.py
5. **Configuration**: Enable/disable controls work as expected

## Deployment Ready

✅ **Implementation Complete**: All functionality working as designed
✅ **Testing Comprehensive**: Edge cases and error conditions covered
✅ **Documentation Complete**: Usage examples and configuration guide provided
✅ **Backwards Compatible**: Existing deployments continue working unchanged
✅ **Performance Optimized**: Minimal overhead, clean shutdown

The dashboard will now maintain fresh data continuously, solving the original stale dashboard issue during idle event queue periods.
