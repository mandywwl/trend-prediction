"""Dashboard package namespace.

This package contains lightweight UI components and data readers used by
the dashboard. Components are intentionally framework-agnostic: each
exposes a small `render_*` function that returns primitives like
matplotlib figures and simple values that can be embedded in Streamlit,
Dash, or custom UIs.
